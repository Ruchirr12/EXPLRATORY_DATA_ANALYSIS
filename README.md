# EXPLRATORY_DATA_ANALYSIS

EDA Folder
The EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Folder is a collection of notebooks and scripts dedicated to exploratory data analysis tasks. This repository provides a set of tools and techniques to analyze and gain insights from datasets.

Contents
The EDA Folder includes the following files and directories:

notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various EDA techniques and showcase real-world data analysis examples. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of EDA and provides step-by-step explanations.

scripts/: This directory contains Python scripts that automate common EDA tasks. These scripts can be used as standalone utilities or incorporated into larger data analysis pipelines.

data/: This directory stores sample datasets used in the notebooks and scripts. You can explore and analyze these datasets to practice EDA techniques and experiment with different analysis methods.

README.md: This README file provides an overview of the EDA Folder and guides users on how to utilize the provided resources effectively.

Usage
To use the EDA Folder, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download and extract the ZIP file.

Navigate to the EDA Folder on your local machine.

Explore the notebooks/ directory and open the Jupyter notebooks using a compatible notebook environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab). Each notebook is self-contained and provides instructions, code snippets, and explanations for performing EDA tasks.

Review the scripts in the scripts/ directory to find utilities that automate common EDA tasks. These scripts can be executed directly or incorporated into your own Python scripts or pipelines.

Use the sample datasets provided in the data/ directory to practice EDA techniques demonstrated in the notebooks or to test and experiment with the EDA scripts.

Customize and adapt the notebooks and scripts to your specific analysis needs. Feel free to modify the code, add your datasets, or extend the functionality to suit your requirements
